I've spent some time organizing the directory and I'm digging into assembly. I literally have no
experience coding assembly at all. My only exposure comes from knowing it's necessity in basic
computing. I've Google'd around a bit and found a few books that I think might help me figure this
stuff out. I'm unsure how much the age of these books will help/hinder my learning experience but
either way, I'm forging ahead.

Spending time reading through a few different resources on numbering including binary and hexdecimal.
It feels pedantic to keep reading over the numbering again and again but I want to be able to use
this knowledge.
