# Level Up

A while back, I found this [excellent post](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/)
by my colleague @jasonrudolph. I'm finally going to tackle this because I've got a little bit of
non-work time right now. Follow along with my unedited and likely embarrassing approach to learning.

## A guide on my journey

* I will be digging into everything I'm not completely convinced I could explain without fault
  to a co-worker, colleague, friend, or newbie. Thus, you'll likely see items in the "Digest"
  lists that make you question if I know anything at all. I'm taking some great advice from
  @r00k and I'm gonna say "I don't know that" when I only have a rough idea about something.
  This will no doubt slow my journey but the goal here is to *understand* as much as possible.
  I don't want to leave this experience with a bunch of "I sort of know that"-s.

**Learn a variety of [programming paradigms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm "Programming paradigm - Wikipedia"):**

* [Write a program in assembly language](assembly-language/README.md)
* Write an application in a functional language
* Write an application in an object-oriented language
* Write an application in a prototype-based language

* Write an application in Forth

**Experience the ins and outs of programming for different platforms:**

* Write a nontrivial web app
